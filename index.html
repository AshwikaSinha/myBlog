		<p>My favourite hobby is Coding. Since, I started to learn coding, I built a huge interest to code and want to become successful coder in my life.Coding is very important for the kids nowadays.Because now the whole world depends on the internet.      We can create apps, games, websites and many more withe the help of coding. It is fun doing coding. We can create apps which will be helpful to people and upload on Play Store and earn a good amount of money. I started coding when I was 12 yrs old, first I had thought that I won't be able to do coding. But my wonderful teacher taught me so well that I started enjoying coding. It was like a game to me. I started creating apps by my own. My ma'am was very impressed with me. I created apps like: Voice Communicator App for Mute People, Audio Books for Children who do not like to Read and many more apps.</p>
